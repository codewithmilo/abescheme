Attribute-Based Encryption for Expressing Client Privacy Options

Prototype: Social networking site with page profiles, options to upload info and status updates, and clients select specific sharing/privacy options. 
-	Collect and encrypt data with public keys with Javascript on page
-	Send AJAX request and send encrypted data to server
-	Use decryption key to decrypt data through PHP on server
-	Display to console the Attribute List with the clientâ€™s chosen options
-	Save decrypted data to database and create page for user

Privacy Options:
-	Who can see information: Advertisers/Service/No one
-	How long updates are shown: Month/Week/Day/Hour
-	Deleted info longevity: Forever/Never
-	Can use data for: Targeted Ads/Statistics/Partners/Nothing
-	Track Usage: Yes/No
-	GPS location: Yes/No

Currently:

1.	Create simple form for signups and updating status
2.	Have a page for displaying profile info
3.	Database for storing personal information
4.	Log to console and display to server user policy

2nd Phase:

1.	Implement proper encryption scheme with encryption/decryption
2.	Store encrypted data in database
3.	Client request either post status or photo content
4.	Server must decrypt (showing user policy) to retrieve data
5.	Serve client requests after policy is presented to server
