Abstract:

As the internet and cloud services have pervaded our lives in nearly
every aspect, one of the biggest issues facing the populace today is
finding the best ways to protect our privacy. An important part of
protection for the average user of a service is their privacy policy:
essentially the only way today to let a client define how their data
is used by the server. But often a client is not given a choice, and
sometimes their policy is not even followed. We present here privateBook,
a prototype for encrypting user data such that they first create a privacy 
policy, and their data is protected from even the service unless their 
privacy requirements are met by the service.

Attribute-Based Encryption library provided by the [Charm crypto library](http://www.charm-crypto.com/Main.html).

privateBook web app built in Python with the Django web framework.
